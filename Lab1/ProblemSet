─Introduction    to    C    and    Basic    I/OSubmit    the    solutions,    C    programs,    to    the    following    problems    underthe    “labtest”    mode    on    September    15    or    18.1.   
Problem    A1.1    SpecificationWrite    a    C    program    to    convert    measurements    from    inches    to    centimetres    (1    inch    =    2.54    cm).       
The    program    reads    a    measurement    in    inches    and    outputs    the    equivalent    measurement    in    centimetres.   
It    then    continues    to    read    and    convert    the    next    measurements    until    a    zero    is    entered.   
1.2    ImplementationThe    program    should:•be    named    lab1a.c•use    a    loop    to    read    and    convert    one    input    at    a    time.  
The    loop    ends    and    the    program    terminates    when    the    input    is    zero.   
•display    before    each    input    the    following    prompt:    Enter the measurement in inches>•use    scanfto    read    inputs,    which    are    measurements    in    inches,    of    type    float.
•display    the    outputs    in    centimetres    with    two    decimal    digits.    1.3

Problem    B2.1    SpecificationWrite    a    C    program    to    count    the    number    of    blank    characters    (white    spaces)    in    a    line    of    characters.  
The    program    reads    from    the    standard    input    a    line    of    characters    and    outputs    the number    of    blank    characters    found    in    the    line. 
2.2    ImplementationThe    program    should:•be    named    lab1b.c•use    getcharand    a    loop    to    read    a    line    of    characters    which    is    terminated    by    the    new    line    character    ‘\n’.
•display    the    following    prompt    before    each    input:Enter a line of characters>2.3

Problem    D Repeat    problem    B,    but    do    not    display    the    prompt    “Enter a line of characters>”.Name    this    program    lab1d.c.
Common    NotesAll    submitted    files    should    contain    the    following    header:
/****************************************EECS2031 –Lab1*Filename:Name of file*

In    addition,    all    programs    should    follow    the    following    guidelines:
•Include    the    stdio.hlibrary    in    the    header    of    your    .cfiles.
•Use    printfto    print    texts    and    outputs    according    to    the    required    formats.   
•End    each    output    result    with    a    new    line    character    ‘\n’.
•Assume    that    all    inputs    are    valid    (no    error    checkingis    required).
